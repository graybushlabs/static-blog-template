  <h2>Welcome to Graybush Labs.</h2>
  We try our best to make sure that the discussions on our articles are troll, spam
  and abuse free but we're not robots. Please make sure to stick to the following
  guidelines:
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 mb-4">
    <li>
      Be polite - don't be rude to anyone and respect others. There is no
      tolerance for any form of abuse or disrespect.
    </li>

    <li>
      Don't troll. We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but
      comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting
      would be deleted without exception.
    </li>

    <li>Spam? No. Never.</li>
  </ul>
  Basically, “Don't be a dick”. If you don't follow any of these guidelines, your
  comment will be removed and you may get banned. If you find any comments which
  violate our guidelines, please make sure to 'flag' or 'mark as spam - our moderators
  highly appreciate your support! Happy commenting!
